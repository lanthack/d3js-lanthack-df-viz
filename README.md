# Dataframe Visualization

This code was developed as a part of a one-day [RWL hackathon](http://randomwalklabs.org). 

## Aim
Visualize any general dataframe (provided as a csv file).

## Demo
1. Clone the repository and run a simple Python server
```
git clone https://github.com/ankur-gupta/d3js-df-viz.git
cd d3js-df-viz
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

2. Navigate your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
3. Upload a CSV file that contains headers.

## Work in progress
This work is not complete. It was developed for fun as a part of one-day hackathon.
